#RAA 

Hello! This the main project I have worked on so far. It has been the best learning experience of my life so far. As the lead in this project,
I do a little bit of everything including managing a team, Solidworks Design, PCB design, soldering, 3D printing and others
that I am probably forgetting. 

Thanks for taking the time to read my intro, please checkout the images of this project and the final paper published in the 
Florida Conference for Recent Advancements in robotics. 

Excited to see what's next in this journey!
